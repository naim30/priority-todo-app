## About The Project

![Landing page Screenshot](public/todoss.jpg)

I made a to-do list with task priorities and assigned different colours to them based on their importance.
You can also sort your tasks by prioritise.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img width="200px" height="200px" alt="high prirority todo list" src="public/high.jpg" style="padding: 10px">
    <img width="200px" height="200px"  alt="medium prirority todo list" src="public/medium.jpg"  style="padding: 10px">
    <img width="200px" height="200px"  alt="low prirority todo list" src="public/low.jpg"  style="padding: 10px">
</div>

- Count on top-right drops as todo is accomplished.
- At the top, you can put a title. You can also delete a todo if it is incorrect.

Here's why:

- to learn how to manipulate the DOM with javascript
